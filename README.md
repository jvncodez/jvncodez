## 🧠 About Me

I am a Software Architect in evolution, currently acting as Coordinator of Development and Operations, focused on backend architecture, secure systems and scalable SaaS solutions.

My work combines:

- Structural backend design  
- API integrations  
- Serverless architecture  
- Automation systems  
- Cybersecurity applied from the foundation  

I don’t just develop features — I design resilient digital structures.

## 🏛 Technical Philosophy

Architecture is not about writing code fast.  
It is about designing systems that resist.

Security is not an add-on.  
It is foundation.

Scalability is not improvisation.  
It is planning.

Every system I design stands on three pillars:

Structure.  
Protection.  
Scale.  

Because a ship without a hull never reaches the river.
